# UofL-Final-Undergrad-Semester
In prior semesters I have made a repository for each class.  This semester I will be keeping all classes in a single repository because none of these individual classes should be as large as previous ones such as Artificial Intelligence.

## Classes
* [Semiconductor Development Fundamentals (ECE 542) - Prof. Shamus McNamara]()
* [Control Systems (ECE 560/561) - Prof. Tamir Inanc]()
* [Introduction to Databases (CECS 535) - Prof. Antonio Badia]()
* [Engineering Methods, Tools, and Practices (ENGR 110) - Prof. Campbell Bego]()
* [Deep Learning (CECS 590) - Prof. Daniel Sierrasosa]()
